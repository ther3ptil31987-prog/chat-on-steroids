/**
 * The order a recorded turn is *read* in, which is not the order it was written in.
 *
 * A tool call is only handed to the recorder once its tool has finished and its attribution
 * has resolved, so it is appended late — but it is stamped with `startedAt`, because that is
 * when it happened. Everything the page observed in the meantime already has a lower `seq`.
 * Reading the log by `seq` therefore shows a call after the commentary it ran underneath, and
 * a slow call after the `turn_end` of the turn that made it: `2026-01-01-00000017` seq 390,
 * `time` 1786982781914, sits after a `turn_start` stamped 1786982783350 — a second and a half
 * in the future of the row above it.
 *
 * The fix is not to sort the log by time. `seq` is the append order and the cursor domain,
 * and it has to stay immutable and gap-free or incremental delivery breaks. And a global
 * sort by time would be actively wrong: a reloaded page re-reports the transcript it can see,
 * and those events carry the time they were *observed*, not the time they were said, so
 * sorting the whole log by time drags days-old history into the middle of the live turn.
 *
 * So ordering is turn-local. A turn this log opened is a durable, bounded group — everything
 * in it carries the same generation id, which the extension mints per turn — and inside that
 * group the recorded times are all live observations of one run, directly comparable. Outside
 * it nothing moves: unowned messages and events retain their recorded position. Store reads
 * carry the owning start as presentation metadata even when it lies outside the loaded page.
 *
 * Both consumers use this. The desktop transcript and the stream the extension injects back
 * into ChatGPT are the same record, and they must not be able to disagree about its order.
