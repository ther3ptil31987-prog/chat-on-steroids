/**
 * Whether a compaction is opening its replacement chat right at this moment.
 *
 * One boolean, in a module of its own, because the two sides of it must not import each
 * other: the continuation owns the transaction and says when a brief has been claimed, and
 * the recorder — which the continuation already depends on — has to be able to ask.
 *
 * The question exists because of what the answer prevents. When a resume opens chat B, two
 * things race to react to B appearing: the recorder, which invents a session for any
 * conversation it has never seen, and the commit, which moves the *existing* session onto B.
 * On 2026-08-23 the recorder won by 302 ms. The commit then found its own destination owned
 * by a session it had never heard of, refused to rebind — "the replacement chat already
 * belongs to another local session" — and the compaction lost its session while the swarm's
 * prime role moved to the new chat anyway. The replacement chat asked its own session for the
 * handoff history, was told it had no recorded events, and rebuilt the work off the
 * filesystem.
 *
 * The content script holds its own opening batch back for exactly this reason
 * (`commandJournalGate`), but that gate cannot cover events already journalled in the
 * extension's service worker, which is how they arrived early anyway. So the invariant is
 * kept here, where it is owned, instead of there, where it is merely usually observed.
 */

/**
 * How long after a claim a replacement chat is still expected to appear.
 *
 * Only has to outlast a browser opening a tab and ChatGPT minting a conversation id — the
 * bridge command that opened it is bounded by its own deadline. Kept short because the
 * window is not free: while it is open, a genuinely unrelated new conversation waits before
 * getting a session of its own.
