/**
 * The folder a chat is currently working in, so it can stop spelling out full paths.
 *
 * A coding session spends its whole life inside one project, and every call was repeating
 * the same prefix: `/project/chat-on-steroids/src/main/patch.ts` where `src/main/patch.ts`
 * would do. That prefix is pure overhead — it costs tokens on every call, and it is the
 * part the model is most likely to get subtly wrong.
 *
 * So a chat's workspace is *learned* from the absolute paths it already uses, and later
 * relative paths resolve against it. An explicit durable session project can initialize
 * this same cwd through the kernel; subsequent learned paths use the same owner. No
 * model-facing tool exists to select another session's workspace.
 *
 * ## Why this is keyed the way it is
 *
 * The hard requirement is that two chats never share a workspace — chat B resolving
 * `src/main/patch.ts` against chat A's project would read, or worse write, the wrong file.
 * The dispatcher now adopts an exact request-id → conversation join before the handler when
 * that evidence is already available. That conversation is stronger than the old
 * sole-generating fallback and must win whenever present.
 *
 * Identity normally comes from the request-correlated conversation. Friendly agent names are
 * local to a run and cannot own cwd. When the user explicitly permits unattributed calls, the
 * turn-level request id is a temporary workspace owner until its exact conversation arrives.
 * That keeps one unresolved workflow coherent without borrowing another chat's folder. Nothing
 * here widens what may be reached; every path still goes through `resolvePath` and every root,
 * containment and symlink check it performs.
